# Text Summarization Project

## Description
This project aims to implement a simple yet effective text summarization tool using Python, leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries such as NLTK and spaCy. The tool preprocesses a given text to remove unnecessary characters, tokenizes it into sentences and words, removes stop words, and then applies a frequency-based scoring system to extract the most relevant sentences as the summary.

## Features
- Text cleaning and preprocessing
- Sentence and word tokenization
- Stop words removal
- Frequency-based importance ranking of sentences
- Generation of text summaries
- Visualizations including word clouds and frequency distribution plots to analyze the text and summaries
